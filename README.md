=========

This is the re-usable stuff of a university project of mine.

The original was written in C# for Windows Store Apps (YES I KNOW) by six inexperienced students and the final code looked accordingly. So you won’t find that here. Instead, have some design documents (the ones that were of any use, that is).


What I Learned™
---------------

* I’m never, ever going to use Visual Studio again
* Data-driven programming is nice, as long as the data isn’t XML and only reasonably editable with a M$ tool that is utter crap.
* XML should die for everything but markup, seriously. I mean, function comments as XML? COME ON!
* Choose your team carefully, if you can. If you can’t, don’t take *anything* for granted. Let me repeat that: **Not a single thing**.
* SVN is hell, git-svn only does so much for you.
* If you use git-svn together with Windows users, go kill yourself. Otherwise the line-endings will kill your sanity.

All of the above are mostly notes so I don’t forget next time.


What I am proud of
------------------

I didn’t misuse any alcohol during the project. Talk about enduring pain. :P
